# Automic Vault

[English](README.md) · [简体中文](README.zh-Hans.md)

**CLI security is broken. The packaging layer is where we fix it.**

I created Homebrew. Now I’m fixing what happens when agents use it.

— [Max Howell](https://mxcl.dev/)

You install tools to do a job. Their credentials often sit in files or helpers
that other code running as you can read. Agents inherit that access.

Automic Vault hardens supported CLI tools on macOS. AV understands how supported
commands use credentials and classifies operations by sensitivity. Set Access
Levels in advance for each app and Tool to reduce Approval prompts without
blanket access. Unknown operations still require Approval.

We move exposed credentials into the Keychain and change how the tools request
them. You keep your commands; AV checks the complete operation before applying
a protected credential.

&nbsp;


## Quickstart

Download the [latest release], or install with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install --cask automic-vault/isotopes/automic-vault
open /Applications/Automic\ Vault.app
```

Scan for exposed credentials, harden a supported Tool, then verify the result:

```sh
av scan   # or open the app
av harden gh
av doctor gh
```

> [!TIP]
> Automic Vault has several other mechanisms (Blessed Scripts, Launcher
> Bundles, the Secret Proxy, Direct Secret Access) for situations a Hardener
> doesn't cover. See [Choosing a Mechanism](docs/choosing-a-mechanism.md) for
> which one fits your situation.

# Product Overview

## Detectors

Automic Vault continuously checks over 100 developer-tool configurations for
Exposures and Hazards, including plaintext credentials, permissive Keychain
items, and ambient credential helpers. Each Finding includes a mitigation.

Detectors inspect without changing your environment or requesting Secrets. A
clean Scan means no supported Detector found an issue; it cannot certify that
your machine is holistically secure.

[Detection coverage and interpreting Findings](docs/tool-hardening.md)

## Hardeners

Hardeners move supported credentials into Secret Custody in the macOS Data
Protection Keychain and configure the Tool's Authorization Gate. Depending on
the Tool, this can mean a credential helper, wrapper, or Isotope: an Automic
Vault-compatible build of the Tool.

`av doctor` verifies the protection Automic Vault installed.

> [!NOTE]
> Our hardeners are best in class.
> AWS hardening gives normal commands short-lived credentials;
> Docker hardening removes ambient registry-helper access.
> Homebrew's Execution Gate controls supported operations even when no Secret is involved.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Our hardeners prove their own necessity: we wouldn’t be able to migrate your
> credentials into Automic Vault if they weren’t *already stored in an exposed
> state*.

[Hardening, verification, and AWS/Docker handoffs](docs/tool-hardening.md)

## Authorization Gates

Automic Vault
checks the Verified Launcher, Tool, Target, command, arguments, working
directory, Secret Names, and selected Value sources before allowing the
complete operation on the Mac where it will run.

With **Read Only** access, one GitHub token produces three decisions:

```text
gh issue list     → automically authorized
gh issue create   → Approval required
gh auth token     → Secret Disclosure; Approval required
```

Each gate applies a default Access Level or a rule for the Verified Launcher.
**Write Access** permits recognized reads and writes; disclosure and elevated
credential use still need Approval. Unknown operations need Approval at every
Access Level.

Automic Vault controls the handoff. The Target controls the Secret after
receiving it.

> [!TIP]
> Default authorization gates to: approval required.
> Give agents: read only.
> Give your terminal: write.
>
> Consider giving your terminal read only also and investing time into
> Blessed Scripts in order to reduce approval fatigue.
>
> Run supply-chain attack sensitive operations like `npm i` in a separate terminal
> with no Automic Authorizations and no macOS TCC permissions.

[Access Levels, Approval, and locked-device behavior](docs/authorization.md)

### Temporary Access Grants

An eligible Codex task or Claude Code session can request **Allow Write Access
for 10 Minutes…**. The in-memory grant covers one Verified Launcher, Tool-specific gate,
and agent task. A visible strip lets you add ten minutes, suspend access and its
countdown, or end the grant.

<img src="./docs/img/temporary-write-access.png" alt="Automic Vault temporary write access controls" style="width: 589px; height: auto" />

The task identifier is a forgeable narrowing label; the Verified Launcher
remains the identity boundary. Grants exclude direct Secret access, Secret
mutations, elevated credential use, disclosure, and unknown operations.

> [!TIP]
> This helps you to keep agents at read-only and approve escalation
> on a task by task basis.

[Grant scope, expiry, and controls](docs/authorization.md#temporary-access-grants)

### Touch ID Approval

Require Touch ID on your Mac for an allow action. Each Approval uses a fresh
biometric result for that exact request, without a password, Apple Watch, or
pointer-driven fallback. Touch ID requires an active Mac session and awake
displays, and can coexist with iPhone Approval.

[Enable Touch ID Approval](docs/authorization.md#touch-id-approval)

### iPhone Approval

Approve operations across your enrolled Macs from eligible iPhones on the same
iCloud Keychain account. Each Mac keeps its Secrets, policy, enforcement, and
Authorization History local; the iPhone never receives Secret Values.

Enabling iPhone Approval removes pointer- and keyboard-driven allow actions
from that Mac. Separately enabled Touch ID Approval can still carry an Approval.

> [!WARNING]
> iPhone Mirroring and **Show on Mac** can put Approval controls back onto a Mac
> when phone biometrics are off. Disable those features wherever an agent can
> control the Mac, or require Face ID or Touch ID on every eligible iPhone.

### Authorization History

Inspect allowed and denied requests, the operations and software involved, and
the decision source. Automic Vault persists and verifies an allowed Secret
Use's record before releasing the Secret; recording failure denies release.

```sh
$ av history
$ av history --since 7d --json
```

Each read requires Approval unless you grant that exact Verified Launcher
Authorization History Access in Settings. This is a separate setting from
`av list`'s Secret Name Access. An unverifiable Launcher cannot use that grant
and needs Approval. The read itself appears in the returned history.

History is local, stored as encrypted rows in one SQLite file with its key in
the Data Protection Keychain. It is available for up to 30 days or 25 MiB of
encrypted record payloads, whichever comes first. `--since` returns every retained
record in the window. Terminal tables use a pager; `--no-pager`, `--json`, and
redirected output bypass it. History is not tamper-proof or a
complete forensic log.

[Authorization History and its limits](docs/authorization.md#authorization-history)

## Verified Launchers

Choose which terminals, IDEs, agents, or eligible standalone CLIs receive
authority. Automic Vault checks the live Launcher's code identity and runtime
protections on each request. Launcher-specific policy names that exact identity.

Code signing proves identity and integrity, not intent. A failed identity or
runtime check blocks automic authorization. Prefer vendor-signed distributions
when available; signing an interpreter does not authenticate the scripts,
dependencies, or plug-ins it loads.

[Launcher eligibility and vendor-signed Tools](docs/signed-cli-launchers.md)

### Launcher Bundles

For an unsigned single-file Mach-O CLI, Automic Vault can snapshot the executable
into a signed Launcher Bundle with Hardened Runtime and a root-owned command
link. Each authorization revalidates its enrolled generation, payload, signatures,
and runtime posture. Changes or re-signing hard-deny its requests.

A Launcher Bundle establishes identity for that packaged code. It cannot
establish publisher trust or make the CLI safe. Scripts and directory-shaped
Tools are unsupported.

> [!TIP]
> Hardened Runtime is an important part of the security model. Without it
> malware and agents can literally read the memory of a running process to
> exfiltrate secrets.

## Secrets

> [!NOTE]
> Hardeners migrate secrets from exposed storage into Automic Vault. You do not
> need to use `av save` yourself—the `av harden` operation does it for you.

Save a secret:

```sh
$ av save API_TOKEN   # prompts via stdin
```

Save a project secret:

```sh
$ av save --project-directory=. API_TOKEN
```

Automic Vault selects the nearest Project Value at or above the physical working
directory, falling back to the Global Value when none matches. A read failure for
the selected Value ends the request without trying another value.

The directory selects a Value and grants no authority. The same name-based
policy covers all Values of that Secret.

- [Project Values, dotenvx, and mise](docs/project-secrets.md)
- [Varlock](docs/varlock.md)

### Save multiline or exact input

```sh
$ av save --multiline DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY
# Hidden input; Ctrl-D finishes after the final newline.
$ av save --stdin API_TOKEN <&3
# Read exact bytes from an existing descriptor until EOF.
```

Both modes require Approval. `--stdin` preserves whitespace and newlines;
Values must be nonempty UTF-8 without NUL bytes, at most 1 MiB.

[Input modes](docs/project-secrets.md#multiline-and-exact-input) ·
[Copy selected v1 Secrets](docs/migrating-from-v1.md)

&nbsp;

    
## Scripting

You can inject secrets into anything:

```sh
av inject +SECRET_NAME -- /path/to/something   # shows an approval window
```

> [!NOTE]
> `av inject` is a primitive we use to build other parts of Automic Vault.
> Direct use (by humans) is rare. Typically if you find yourself using it you
> may be better served reaching for one of our other tools.

> [!TIP]
> Hardened tools have named secrets you can use with `av inject`, eg. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`.

> [!NOTE]
> There is no direct way to print a secret to stdout. This is deliberate.
> Any situation that requires you to take and hold a secret is a bad situation
> that you should try to work around.
>
> All the same if you must: `av inject +FOO -- sh -c "echo $FOO"`

For reduced exposure†, we support injecting via file descriptors instead of
environment variables:

```sh
$ av inject --mode=fd +FOO:3 +BAR:4 -- /path/to/something
```

Each Secret arrives through its own anonymous pipe as exact stored bytes,
followed by EOF. Automic Vault removes the requested names from the Target's
environment and requires fresh Approval for every invocation. Descriptors must
be unused, and each Value must fit the available pipe buffer.

[FD delivery and its limits](docs/direct-secret-access.md#apply-secrets-through-file-descriptors)

> † Environment variables both spread to child processes and allow any part of
> large codebases to read them.

Direct injection can be automatically authorized for a Verified Launcher.
We do not recommend this: we recommend using blessed scripts.

### Blessed Scripts

Review a script once and bind its canonical path, exact contents, declaration,
and capabilities to a Blessing:

```sh
$ av bless ./path/to/script
```

The script declares the Secrets and Tool capabilities it needs:

```sh
#!/usr/local/bin/av inject +DEPLOY_TOKEN -- /bin/bash
# --- automic-vault
# capabilities:
#   gh: read-only
#   aws: write
# ---
```

For compatibility, omitting the manifest inherits automic authority already
available from the calling context. Make that choice explicit with:

```sh
# --- automic-vault
# capabilities: { inherit: true }
# ---
```

Use an empty declaration to ensure every later gated operation requires
Approval while Automic Vault can attribute it to the live script execution,
regardless of which Launcher calls the script:

```sh
# --- automic-vault
# capabilities: {}
# ---
```

The Secret Names in the `av inject` shebang are authorized separately. A script
with no Secret Names and `capabilities: {}` starts without Approval because it
receives no Automic Vault authority. This is an authorization ceiling, not a
sandbox: ordinary commands still run with the user's normal operating-system
permissions. Restarting Automic Vault or losing observable ancestry ends the
memory-only ceiling, just as it ends active Blessed Script state.

Compatibility debts reserved for the next major version are tracked in
[Future Breaking Changes](docs/future-breaking-changes.md).

Editing the script or declaration invalidates the Blessing. A Launcher
Endorsement lets one Verified Launcher automically authorize that exact
Blessing. Use Blessed Scripts for reviewed work that exits, and Tool
Authorization Gates for long-running processes.

FD delivery currently requires fresh Approval, including when invoked inside a
Blessed Script. FD mode in an `av inject` shebang is unsupported.

[Blessings and execution guarantees](docs/domain-language.md#blessed-script) ·
[Running scripts across app restarts](docs/direct-secret-access.md#blessed-script-lifecycle)

#### Reentrant Blessed Scripts

A reentrant Blessed Script does deterministic work until it needs agent input,
then prints a prompt and exits. The prompt names the required output, fixed
subcommands that expose reviewed capabilities, and the command to continue.

Automic Vault authorizes every invocation separately. Keep Secret Values within
the script's execution and validate agent output before using it.

[Release example with GitHub, S3, and CloudFront](docs/examples/reentrant-release.sh)
includes input validation, digest checks, conditional writes, and idempotent
retries.

## GPG Signing

Sign Git commits and tags without giving Git the private key or passphrase.
The GPG Signing Gate authorizes private-key use while your normal Git commands
keep working. You can select a separate signing credential for exact Verified
Launchers so agents use a distinct signing identity.

The gate offers **Approval Required** and **Allow Signing**. The signing
Target handles the private key while creating the signature.

[Configure Git signing](docs/securing-git.md#gate-gpg-commit-signing)
    
## SSH Agent

Use our SSH-agent; not because you are exposed—that is easy to mitigate—but because
agents and malware should not be able to `ssh` to any host your keys connect to without
your consent.

With our ssh-agent allow specific apps to `ssh`; everything else gets a gate.

&nbsp;

    
## Credential Proxies

AV's Secret Proxy gives your application a random, session-specific Secret
Reference in place of each Secret Value:

```sh
$ av save API_TOKEN
$ av proxy +API_TOKEN -- node --use-env-proxy app.js
```

The proxy applies the real Secret when that reference appears in an approved
outbound HTTP/S request. Starting a Proxy Session and adding a destination
require Approval. **Allow for Session** remembers that origin and Secret Name
only for the session.

The application must support the supplied proxy and scoped CA settings. Secret
References and the Proxy Credential are bearer values: code that obtains them
can use destinations already allowed for that session.

[Application example, `.env`, and compatibility](docs/secret-proxy.md)

The [Varlock integration](docs/varlock.md) resolves Secrets through `ENV` and
can compose with Varlock's own credential proxy. It requires one Approval per
run and does not support Automic Authorization or Blessings. Varlock's proxy
and `av proxy` are separate sessions; don't nest them.

&nbsp;


## Security Boundaries

Automic Vault protects against untrusted or compromised code running with your
normal user privileges. It builds on macOS code signing, the Data Protection
Keychain, TCC, Hardened Runtime, and live process identity.

Root or kernel compromise, arbitrary local destruction, and a Target's behavior
after receiving a Secret remain outside the product boundary. Wrappers cannot
intercept every process execution. Keep your terminal and agent harness's
[macOS permissions minimal](docs/tool-hardening.md#rescind-unneeded-terminal-permissions).

&nbsp;

    
## Companion Apps

Network filtering and general-purpose agent sandboxing are outside Automic
Vault's scope and roadmap. These apps cover those needs:

- [Tiny Shield](https://tinyshield.proxyman.com) monitors your Mac's network
  connections and lets you block apps or domains. Automic Vault controls whether
  an operation may use a protected credential; Tiny Shield adds control over
  where apps can connect, including traffic that uses no credential.
- [agentsh](https://www.agentsh.org) applies file, network, and process policies
  to agents run through it. Use it to restrict workspace access and command
  execution alongside Automic Vault's Secret Custody and Authorization Gates.
  Those restrictions address local actions, such as deleting files, that need
  no protected Secret and may never reach an Automic Vault gate.
