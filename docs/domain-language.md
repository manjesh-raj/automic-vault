# Automic Vault Domain Language

Status: authoritative
Applies to: endorsed Automic Vault products, interfaces, and documentation

Automic Vault protects developer credentials at two boundaries: where they are stored and where they are used. Its domain is developer authority, with secrets and the application of those secrets at its center. Execution control, including Homebrew control, belongs to the same domain even when an operation uses no secret.

This document defines the language used across the Automic Vault ecosystem. Product copy should favor the user-facing terms. Architecture and implementation may use the precise terms where the distinction affects security.

## Product thesis

Automic Vault grants bounded Developer Authority over a complete operation. A
Launcher does not gain authority to retrieve a Secret merely by presenting an
identity or Secret Name. Each Authorization Decision covers one complete,
immutable Authorization Request, including the Verified Launcher, Gate Client,
Target, command, arguments, working directory, requested Secret Names, and
selected Secret Value sources.

Secret Application is the normal use of a Secret. Secret Disclosure is a
separate operation whose Authorization Request and Authorization Decision must
identify it explicitly. Execution Gates apply the same authority model to
controlled operations that use no Secret.

## Security model

The primary adversary is untrusted or compromised code running with the user's normal privileges: an agent, dependency, plugin, script, or supply-chain payload. Automic Vault builds on macOS code signing, Keychain, TCC, Hardened Runtime, and process identity, with the user as the final authority.

Automic Vault addresses two threat categories:

- **Unprotected Credential Access:** code can retrieve a credential through a plaintext file, environment variable, permissive Keychain item, credential-helper command, or similar mechanism.
- **Unauthorized Secret Application:** code causes a protected secret to be applied to an operation without authority from policy or the user.

Automic Vault does not claim to contain a root or kernel compromise, prevent arbitrary local destruction, or make a Target trustworthy after it receives a secret.

## Authority and gates

### Developer Authority

The authority to use developer credentials and perform controlled developer operations. Automic Vault helps the user delegate this authority to verified software with bounded policies.

### Authorization Gate

A boundary that decides whether an operation may proceed. Every gate owns one Authorization Policy.

- A **Secret Gate** controls the application or disclosure of protected secrets.
- An **Execution Gate** controls an operation without requiring a secret. Homebrew is the current example.

### Direct Secret Gate

The built-in Secret Gate for direct `av inject` requests that do not belong to a
Tool-specific Secret Gate. Its default Access Level is Approval Required.

A **Direct Access Rule** binds one exact Secret Name to one Verified Launcher and
grants Direct Access. It does not use patterns and does not authorize Secret
Disclosure, listing Secret Names, changing Secrets, or sibling Launchers. Because
the Launcher may choose any Target and arguments for each request, Direct Access
delegates more authority than a Tool-specific Secret Gate or Blessed Script.

### Secret Proxy Gate

The built-in Secret Gate for `av proxy`. It applies exact named Secrets to
approved public HTTP origins without placing raw Secret values in the launched
Target's environment. The gate has no durable Authorization Policy in its
initial form: starting every Proxy Session requires Approval, and destination
authority lasts at most for that session.

### GPG Signing Gate

The built-in Tool-specific Secret Gate for Git commit and tag signatures made
through the bundled `av-gpg` Command. `av-gpg` adapts Git's GPG-compatible
interface to the signed `av gpg-sign` Target, which receives one selected GPG
Signing Credential only after the complete signing request is authorized and
recorded. Git and `av-gpg` receive the detached signature, never the private key
or passphrase.

GPG signing is a Local Write operation. Because every recognized operation at
this gate is signing, it exposes only **Approval Required** and **Allow
Signing**. Allow Signing is the GPG-specific presentation of Local Write. The
gate defaults to Approval Required.

### SSH Agent Gate

The built-in Tool-specific Secret Gate for SSH authentication signatures through
Automic Vault's optional SSH agent. One SSH Credential is used for every
Verified Launcher; there are no Launcher-specific credential selectors or
Project Values at this gate. The credential contains an OpenSSH private key and
its optional passphrase in one protected Secret, `AV_SSH_CREDENTIAL`.

Each request binds the live local socket peer, its Verified Launcher, the signed
`av` Gate Client and signing Target, and the exact authentication payload.
The Verified Launcher must be a live original ancestor: the socket peer cannot
represent itself as a Launcher. Every parent execution must match the kernel's
original-parent evidence; unavailable or changed ancestry denies use.
The gate defaults to **Approval Required** and offers **Allow Authentication**
for recognized SSH authentication signatures. This delegates authentication,
including access that may permit remote writes; it is not Read Only authority.
Script-derived authority may authorize authentication only through an explicit
`ssh-agent: trusted` Capability when the SSH socket peer's verified original
ancestors include that exact script execution. An empty capability ceiling
or a revoked active Blessing blocks inherited automatic authority. The ancestry
and Blessing are rechecked before signing; a missing or changed link cannot
borrow the script's authority.
Public-key enumeration does not apply a Secret. Agent key mutation and arbitrary
signing are unsupported. No destination-specific authority is claimed. A local
client that forwards or shares its connection can carry other software's
requests under its Launcher attribution.

### Proxy Session

A live, memory-only Secret Proxy Gate context bound to one complete command and
one exact process identity: PID version, process start time, and, when macOS can
provide one, live Target code identity. It ends when that execution exits, Automic Vault or its proxy
helper exits, or the user terminates it.

A Proxy Session binds lifetime, not the provenance of each loopback TCP
connection. A normal HTTP proxy cannot securely attribute an individual request
to the approved PID. Code that obtains the session's Proxy Credential and
Secret References may exercise authority already granted to that session.

### Secret Reference

A high-entropy, session-specific placeholder for one Secret Name. A Secret
Reference contains no Secret bytes. It is a bearer value: possession together
with the session's Proxy Credential permits requesting Secret Application
within that Proxy Session's authorized destinations.

### Proxy Credential

A high-entropy bearer credential required to connect to one loopback Secret
Proxy. It prevents accidental or unauthenticated use; it does not identify the
process that opened a TCP connection.

### Destination Rule

A memory-only rule created when the user selects Allow for Session while
approving a complete proxy request. It binds exact Secret Names to one canonical
HTTP origin and may authorize later requests only within the same Proxy Session
and origin. The initial request is approved by the user; later matching requests
receive decisions from the Destination Rule. The rule is not a Blessing,
Launcher Endorsement, or durable Authorization Policy. Selecting Allow Once
creates no rule. Every allowed Secret Application still requires its own
Authorization Record before release.

### Local Execution Boundary

The point on the Mac where Automic Vault decides whether a Verified Launcher may apply a protected Secret or perform a gated operation through a Target. Secret storage, identity verification, policy evaluation, enforcement, and Authorization History remain on the Mac. A companion device may carry an Approval, but the Mac enforces the resulting Authorization Decision.

## Participants

### User

The human authority who chooses policy, grants Approval, stores Secrets, hardens Tools, and blesses scripts.

### Launcher

The app or executable at the root of the operation's verified launch chain, such as Terminal or Codex.

### Verified Launcher

A live Launcher whose code signature, designated requirement, and runtime protections meet the gate's eligibility rules. Code signing establishes identity and integrity, not intent. Failed verification prevents automic authorization.

Eligible Launchers enable Hardened Runtime or are Apple platform binaries signed
as part of a macOS release, for which macOS applies the runtime protections
intrinsically. A gate may accept narrowly defined compatibility exceptions while
continuing to block runtime capabilities that permit environment-driven code
injection, disable executable-page protection, or allow debugger attachment. A
Launcher that disables library validation may be eligible, but the UI must warn
that third-party libraries and plug-ins can run inside its process and inherit
its authority.

### Launcher Bundle

An Automic Vault-generated macOS app bundle containing one fixed CLI payload
and a minimal launcher executable. The launcher starts the payload as its parent
process, and the bundle seals the payload. Enrollment binds the exact signed
bundle generation and final bundled payload digest. Automic Vault ad-hoc signs
the bundle with Hardened Runtime. Developer ID-signed generations created by
earlier releases remain bound to their exact enrollment until replaced.
The bundled payload has its own reserved child identity and is reverified when
live. It is not a separate Launcher Identity, but an exact live enrolled payload
may represent its Launcher Bundle Identity after its launcher exits, including
when the payload daemonizes.

Each Launcher Bundle exposes one Command through a root-owned command link. The
Command is how the user invokes the bundle; it is not Launcher Identity. The
installed bundle and command link are protected system artifacts, while the
original executable remains a separate unverified executable.

A Launcher Bundle is an artifact, not an Authorization Gate, Blessing, Isotope,
or Verified Launcher. When its enrolled identity, integrity, and runtime posture
are verified, its live launcher process or live enrolled payload representative
qualifies as the same Verified Launcher. The original unbundled executable has
a different identity and cannot match the Launcher Bundle's enrollment or
Launcher-specific rules.

Changing or re-signing any enrolled generation invalidates it. A bundle that
claims Automic Vault's Launcher Bundle identity but lacks matching enrollment
evidence is denied rather than considered as an ordinary Launcher.

### Launcher Runtime Requirement

The maximum Hardened Runtime exception profile accepted when a durable
Launcher rule is created. It is stored with the rule and checked against the
live Launcher on every request. Removing an accepted exception remains valid;
adding an exception beyond the stored requirement disables automic
authorization. Legacy rules that predate runtime requirements retain their
existing compatibility behavior.

### Agent Task Context

An ephemeral narrowing label for one recognized agent invocation. The initial
providers are a Codex task identified by a canonical UUID in
`CODEX_THREAD_ID` and a Claude Code session identified by a canonical UUID in
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`. Automic Vault accepts a context only when exactly one
recognized provider variable is present in the live process environment.
For the setuid Homebrew Gate Client, macOS prevents the approval service from
inspecting that environment. The signed brew stub transports its own bounded
provider variable with its single Authorization Request instead. This exception
applies only at the Homebrew Execution Gate; it supplies no Launcher identity.
See [ADR 0045](adr/0045-homebrew-agent-task-context.md).

An Agent Task Context is forgeable by software running as the user. It is not
identity, authentication, or a security boundary and grants no authority by
itself. The Verified Launcher remains the identity boundary. Automic Vault
keeps the exact UUID in memory only and does not include it in Authorization
History or telemetry.

### Launcher Identity

The designated requirement stored when the user establishes trust and revalidated for each request. A path, display name, process identifier, or icon is metadata, not identity.

For an ordinary app Launcher, integrity validation covers the app's signed main
executable and the exact executable representing the Launcher. Other resources
in the app bundle are outside the Launcher Identity and are not evidence for or
against it. If targeted resource validation is unavailable, Automic Vault
validates the complete bundle. Launcher Bundles retain their separately defined
complete enrollment and integrity checks.

### Verified Launcher Helper

A vendor-signed executable that may represent one exact containing app as its
Launcher even though it is not that app's declared main executable. The
association binds the helper and app signing identities and is enabled through
an explicit positive catalog. The catalog contains reviewed built-in
associations and associations the user explicitly approves after Automic Vault
discovers signed helpers sealed inside an app. A user-approved association also
binds the helper's relative path inside that app. User-approved associations
and disabled entries are stored in the Data Protection Keychain. Discovery,
bundle containment, a filename, a path, or a shared Team ID alone never creates
an association.

Automic Vault verifies the live helper, the app's signed executable, and that
the exact helper file is a required unmodified resource in the app's resource
seal before attributing the app's Launcher Identity. If any check fails, the
helper does not receive the app identity; an independently eligible Developer
ID executable may still qualify under its own standalone Launcher Identity.
An enabled association applies wherever policy names the containing app's
Launcher Identity, across every current and future Authorization Gate. The user
must be warned about that authority expansion before approving an association
and may disable it without changing the app's Launcher-specific rules.

### Retained Launcher Provenance

Ephemeral evidence that Automic Vault recorded one exact live process execution
between a Gate Client and a Verified Launcher during a successful automic
authorization at one Authorization Gate. If the original parent chain later
disappears, detached-process access can recover the same Launcher attribution at
the same gate.

Retained Launcher Provenance is not an Approval, Authorization Policy, or new
Launcher Identity. Every later request is classified again under the gate's
current policy. It does not apply to another gate, process execution, user
session, or system boot, and uncertainty about the live process execution denies
reuse.

### Gate Client

The signed component that submits an Authorization Request, such as `av`, a patched `gh`, or the Homebrew stub.

### Target

The exact executable that performs the requested operation. For a Secret Gate, the Target is the intended consumer of the Secret Application. The designation limits the intended consumer but cannot prevent a compromised Target from leaking a secret after receipt.

An Approval presents the live process path between the Target and Verified
Launcher and reports the available code-signing and runtime posture for each
process. This is diagnostic evidence about Secret exposure, not authority or
Target identity. In particular, signing an interpreter executable does not
authenticate the mutable source code, dependencies, plug-ins, or native
extensions that it loads.

### Tool and Command

A **Tool** is a developer-facing product or integration. A **Command** is a named executable entry point. A Tool may expose several Commands and Targets. A Hardener may manage more than one of them.

Use Launcher, Gate Client, and Target in security-sensitive prose. Avoid the ambiguous terms *caller* and *requester* except in external APIs, compatibility flags, or historical implementation names.

## Secrets

### Secret

A protected capability identified by one Secret Name. A Secret contains one or
more opaque, sensitive Values under Automic Vault's control.

### Secret Name

The identifier used to request a Secret. Use *Secret Name* instead of the overloaded word *key* in product language.

Authorization policy names the Secret, not an individual Value. A rule that
authorizes a Secret Name therefore covers every current and future Value of that
Secret Name.

### Secret Value

The opaque bytes selected when a Secret is used. A Secret may have one Global
Value and any number of Project Values.

### Global Value

The Secret Value used when no Project Value matches the Authorization Request's
working directory.

### Project Value

A Secret Value associated with one Project Directory. Project Values are
selection context, not an authorization boundary. The nearest matching Project
Directory is selected independently for each requested Secret Name.

### Project Directory

An existing directory represented by its canonical absolute path. The path is a
selector for a Project Value, not an identity or proof of authority. Moving the
directory does not move the Project Value; recreating a directory at the same
path makes that Project Value selectable again.

### Credential

One or more Secrets interpreted by a Tool or service. An AWS credential, for example, may contain an access key identifier and a secret access key.

### GPG Signing Credential

A Credential containing one OpenPGP private-key Secret and, when the key is
encrypted, its passphrase Secret. The user may configure a default credential
and an alternate credential. A Launcher Signing Credential Rule selects the
alternate credential for an exact Verified Launcher; absence of the alternate
credential fails closed and never falls back to the default.

### Launcher Signing Credential Rule

A durable, Keychain-protected rule binding one Verified Launcher designated
requirement to the alternate GPG Signing Credential. It changes Secret
selection, not Launcher Identity or the GPG Signing Gate's Authorization
Policy. Adding or removing a rule is an authority change that requires
Approval.

### Secret Use

The umbrella term for Secret Application and Secret Disclosure.

### Live Secret Use

An in-memory observation that a Target process lifetime associated with an
allowed Secret Use remains live. It presents any Verified Launcher attribution,
the Target, and Secret Names for display; it is not continuing authority, proof
that a Secret remains in memory, or a way to revoke Secret Values already
released.

### Secret Application

The release of a Secret to its designated Target for an authorized operation. This is the normal way Automic Vault uses secrets.

For the Secret Proxy Gate, the signed proxy helper is the immediate Target of
Secret Application. The launched Target receives only Secret References. The
helper applies a Secret to an authorized outbound request and must discard its
request-scoped copy when that request completes.

### Secret Delivery

The mechanism used to apply a Secret to its Target. `av inject` uses environment
variables by default. With `--mode=fd`, each requested Secret Name maps to one
anonymous pipe at an explicit Target file descriptor. The delivery mode and
complete mapping are part of the Authorization Request and Authorization Record.
FD delivery requires fresh Approval; existing Direct Access Rules, Blessings,
and Tool-specific policies do not authorize it. It removes the requested Secret
Names from the Target's environment. It does not prevent the Target from copying
Secret bytes or sharing its descriptors after receipt.

### Secret Disclosure

The intentional return of a raw Secret value to the Launcher, standard output, clipboard, or another general-purpose destination. `gh auth token` is a Secret Disclosure even though it has no remote side effect.

### Secret Availability

The Keychain availability chosen for a Secret and shared by all its Values:

- **When Unlocked:** available while the user's device is unlocked.
- **Available While Locked:** available after the first unlock following a restart.

Availability can prevent an authorized operation. It cannot authorize one. Human Approval requires an active user session and awake displays. An automically authorized operation may continue while locked only when every requested Secret is Available While Locked.

When iPhone Approval is enabled and at least one iPhone has registered for the
same iCloud Keychain account, the iPhone is an active human-presence surface.
The Mac user session may be inactive or its displays asleep while it waits for
that Approval. This exception does not apply to Mac-local input such as an AWS
MFA code, and it ends immediately when iPhone Approval is disabled or recovered.

## Authorization

### Authorization Request

The complete, immutable description of one operation. It binds the Launcher,
Gate Client, Target, command, arguments, working directory, requested Secret
Names, selected Secret Value sources, relevant options, and process identity.

### Authorization Policy

The durable rules for one Authorization Gate. A policy contains:

- a default Access Level for every Verified Launcher without a specific rule;
- Launcher-specific rules chosen by the user.

An unverifiable Launcher does not receive the default Access Level. An unknown operation cannot be automically authorized.

### Policy Decision

The allow or deny result produced by applying an Authorization Policy to an Authorization Request.

### Approval

An explicit human decision to allow one Authorization Request. Approval never names a policy result.

### iPhone Approval

An optional Approval transport that moves every human Approval for an enrolled
Mac to an iPhone signed in to the same iCloud Keychain account. The iPhone
carries an Approval; it does not evaluate Authorization Policy, retrieve a
Secret, persist Authorization History, or enforce an Authorization Decision.

While iPhone Approval is enabled, the Mac exposes no pointer- or keyboard-driven
allow action. An unavailable phone or relay never restores one. If the user has
separately enabled Touch ID Approval, the Mac may expose that biometric-only
surface whether or not the relay is available. The Mac continues to verify the
exact Authorization Request, reject stale or replayed responses, persist the
required Authorization Record, and enforce the resulting Authorization Decision.

The responding iPhone requires an active, App Store-verified iPhone Approval
subscription to carry an allow response. Missing, expired, revoked, or
unverified subscription state fails closed but does not prevent denial. A
subscription is product eligibility, not Authorization Policy or authority to
release a Secret.

iPhone Approval changes where the human decision occurs, not whether an exact
Authorization Decision may receive memory-only transient reuse. Reuse is bound
to the same live process and complete Authorization Request identity and does
not reuse the phone response itself.

### Request History

A bounded, device-local convenience list of Authorization Request summaries
observed by one iPhone. It records Approval responses successfully sent from
that phone and pending requests whose cancellation the iPhone received from the
Mac. A Request History entry is not an Authorization Record and does not
establish that the Mac accepted a response, allowed an operation, or why it
canceled a request. It contains no Secret Values and does not replace the Mac's
authoritative Authorization History.

### Touch ID Approval

An optional Mac-local Approval surface that requires a fresh Touch ID result for
one exact Authorization Request. It has no password, passcode, Apple Watch, or
pointer-driven allow fallback and does not reuse a prior biometric result.

Transient reuse of the resulting exact Authorization Decision is not biometric
result reuse. A later request may avoid another Approval only while the same
live process and complete Authorization Request identity still match.

Touch ID Approval is an explicit per-Mac choice stored in the macOS Data
Protection Keychain. Enabling it requires the current human Approval surface and
a successful Touch ID evaluation. Disabling it removes authority and needs no
Approval. It may coexist with iPhone Approval, but relay failure never enables it
or changes its policy. It requires an active Mac user session and awake displays
and does not provide iPhone Approval's physical separation from the Mac.

By default, an enabled Touch ID Approval surface starts biometric evaluation
inside the displayed Approval window using Apple's native view. A successful
touch approves that request once. The user may disable this presentation to
require a click before the system Touch ID prompt starts. This independent
Keychain-protected preference does not enable Touch ID Approval or grant
broader authority.

### Authorization Decision

The final allow or deny result and its source. An allowed request is either **automically authorized** by policy or **approved** by the user.

### Denial Threshold

A durable, Keychain-protected Launcher-specific rule at one Authorization Gate
that denies operations at the selected Access Level and above without Approval.
The gate's supported presets define the order: the selected level denies every
operation not allowed by its preceding preset. Approval Required means deny all.
Unknown operations are denied whenever a threshold is set. A denial-only rule continues to inherit the gate default allow level.
A matching denial wins over every source of allow authority, including Blessings and reused
Authorization Decisions. Removing or weakening a threshold requires the same
human authority as broadening an Access Level.

### Temporary Launcher Denial

An explicit user decision to deny new requests attributable to one Verified
Launcher across Authorization Gates for two elapsed minutes. It follows Launcher
Identity across Gate Client restarts, remains in memory, and ends on expiry or
service restart. It overrides allow authority without revoking existing grants
or already released Secrets. Expiry restores ordinary policy; it never approves
a request. Repeated Approval presentations offer this action but never activate
it automatically. Caller cancellation is not a denial rule.

### Temporary Access Grant

An in-memory, user-confirmed delegation of Write Access to one exact
Tool-specific Authorization Gate, Verified Launcher, accepted Launcher Runtime
Requirement, and Agent Task Context with an initial ten minutes of active
countdown time.
It may automically authorize recognized read and write operations at that scope.
Elevated Secret Application, Secret Disclosure, Unknown operations, the Direct
Secret Gate, and Secret mutation operations remain outside the grant.

A Temporary Access Grant can begin only when the user selects its explicit
action in an eligible live write-request Approval. It is not a
durable Authorization Policy or Blessing. Automic Vault continuously indicates
every active grant. By default, a persistent strip shows each grant's
successful-use count and last-use time. The user may opt to collapse the strip
after five seconds into a visible warning tab at the nearest screen edge; the
menu-bar item remains orange and continues to expose every grant and action.
The user can add ten minutes of active countdown time, suspend or resume its
countdown, or end each grant immediately. Automic Vault revokes all grants when
the user session becomes inactive, displays sleep, an update begins, or the
service terminates. A suspended countdown also suspends the grant's authority:
requests cannot match it until the user resumes it. The remaining active time is
preserved while suspended. Running countdowns and resumed deadlines use both
wall and monotonic clocks.

Grant matching occurs when Automic Vault makes the Authorization Decision. A
still-live request received before the grant began may therefore use it when
the request reaches that decision point, but only after every live identity,
runtime, task-context, operation, recording, and release check succeeds.

### Fail Closed

Uncertainty about policy or operation risk disables automic authorization and requires Approval. Uncertainty about identity, integrity, request completeness, Secret matching, selected Secret Value, or required Authorization Record persistence denies the request. An error must not fall back to another Secret Value or broader access.

## Operation Characteristics

The policy engine's target model describes an operation with a set of characteristics:

- **Read Only:** reads state without an intended side effect.
- **Homebrew Update:** refreshes Homebrew package definitions and local bookkeeping through `brew update`. It does not install, upgrade, reinstall, or remove software.
- **Local Write:** changes files or state owned by the current user.
- **System Write:** changes shared machine state, installed software, protected locations, or configuration outside the user's local project state.
- **Remote Write:** changes state in a remote service.
- **Elevated Secret Application:** applies a more powerful or reusable credential than the operation normally receives.
- **Unconstrained Secret Application:** applies a Secret through direct `av inject` to a Target and arguments selected by the Verified Launcher, without Tool-specific operation policy.
- **Secret Disclosure:** returns a raw Secret value to a general-purpose destination.
- **Unknown:** the Tool policy cannot establish the operation's characteristics.

An operation may have more than one characteristic. A deployment can perform System Write and Remote Write. An AWS read command that requires reusable keys can be Read Only and Elevated Secret Application. Policy must permit every characteristic. Unknown always prevents automic authorization.

Users should see the command and a concrete reason for an Approval request. System Write and Remote Write explain risk; they are not separate settings.

## Access Levels

An **Access Level** is a named policy preset for one Launcher at one Authorization Gate. Access Levels are not a universal ordinal ladder because gates expose only the presets that fit their operations.

| Access Level | Automic authorization |
| --- | --- |
| **Approval Required** | None. The user may approve a complete request once. |
| **Read Only** | Recognized Read Only operations. |
| **Read & Update** | Recognized Read Only and Homebrew Update operations. Available only at the Homebrew Execution Gate. |
| **Local Write** | Recognized Read Only and Local Write operations. |
| **Write Access** | Recognized read and write operations. Elevated Secret Application and Secret Disclosure still require Approval. |
| **Full Access** | Recognized operations, including Elevated Secret Application and Secret Disclosure. Unknown operations still require Approval. |
| **Direct Access** | Unconstrained Secret Application for exact Secret Names named by Direct Access Rules. Available only at the Direct Secret Gate. |

Every requested characteristic must fit the selected preset. Gates may omit presets that do not describe their operation set.

The Homebrew Execution Gate does not expose Read Only. Homebrew may update itself and its package metadata while running inspection commands, so Automic Vault treats Read Only and Homebrew Update as one indivisible level: Read & Update.

## Detection and hardening

### Detector

A read-only check for one supported Exposure or Hazard in the developer environment.
A Detector never initiates Secret Use or executes a configured credential helper.
When runtime behavior cannot be established without crossing an Authorization
Gate, it relies on passive evidence and may report the uncertainty as a Hazard.

### Scan

A point-in-time run of the available Detectors. A clean Scan means no supported Detector found an issue. It does not mean the environment is secure.

### Finding

A concrete local condition reported by a Detector.

### Exposure

A usable path through which code running as the user can obtain a Secret or Credential.

### Hazard

A condition that increases the likelihood or impact of an Exposure.

### Compromise

Evidence that an unauthorized party obtained or used a Secret or Credential. Never infer Compromise from an Exposure or Hazard alone.

### Hardener and Hardening

A **Hardener** is a Tool-specific procedure that moves the Tool toward declared security invariants. **Hardening** applies that procedure through migration, configuration, a wrapper, or an Isotope.

A Hardener-installed wrapper may request Secret Application only for a reviewed
set of Tool operations. An invocation outside that set may execute with the
protected Secret removed from its environment. That invocation makes no Secret
Use request; it is not an Unknown operation receiving automic authorization.
An explicit Secret Use request whose characteristics remain Unknown still
requires Approval.

### Hardened State

The current, verifiable invariants established by a Hardener. Hardened State does not mean fully safe.

### Doctor

A verifier for Automic Vault's intervention. Doctor checks declared invariants such as identity, ownership, permissions, dependencies, and command resolution. A Detector evaluates the developer environment; Doctor verifies the protection Automic Vault installed.

### Isotope

An Automic Vault-compatible build or wrapper of a third-party Tool. Each Isotope
asset is produced by its Automic Vault-maintained fork and published on that
fork's release. The signed Isotopes Homebrew tap pins the expected fork release
URL and digest. A Hardener constrains that manifest to the Tool's exact fork,
verifies the release digest and Automic Vault code signature, and installs the
Isotope through the signed tap when Homebrew is available unless a reviewed
Tool-specific installer owns its multi-file runtime. A direct Hardener assumes
responsibility for updates. Executable-only Isotopes use `/usr/local/bin`;
reviewed multi-file distributions use a Tool-specific protected prefix. An
Isotope is not a Detector, Hardener, or Secret.

## Reviewed automation

### Script Declaration

The requested Secret Names, Target, injection options, and per-Gate capabilities declared by a script.

### Blessing

A durable record of human review bound to a script's canonical path, exact contents, and complete Script Declaration.

### Blessed Script

A script whose current file still matches its Blessing. Any content or declaration change invalidates the Blessing.

Execution normally uses a verified snapshot. If an interpreter cannot execute
that snapshot, the user may accept canonical-path execution while creating the
Blessing. Automic Vault warns during review and on every run because another
same-user process can change the file after verification and before the
interpreter opens it. The Blessing records the user's choice; an existing
Blessing cannot gain this exception during an upgrade.

### Capability

The maximum Access Level a Blessed Script may receive through one Authorization Gate.

### Capability Inheritance

Compatibility behavior that lets a script continue to use automic authority
available from its execution context, including an outer Blessed Script, its
Verified Launcher's Authorization Policy and Direct Access Rules, and a matching
Temporary Access Grant. Capability Inheritance grants no authority by itself.

A Script Declaration with no capabilities manifest inherits by default. The
declaration `capabilities: { inherit: true }` makes that behavior explicit.
`capabilities: {}` disables Capability Inheritance and declares an empty
capability ceiling: after any Secret Names requested by the script's own shebang
are separately authorized, every later gated operation attributable to that live
execution requires Approval. Neither form makes the script safe, prevents
ordinary ungated execution, or follows a child after its script ancestry becomes
unobservable.

### Launcher Endorsement

Permission for one Verified Launcher to execute an exact Blessing with automic authorization. Launcher Endorsement does not transfer to sibling Launchers or a changed script.

## Authorization History

### Authorization History Access

A durable, Keychain-protected grant allowing one exact Verified Launcher to read
the bounded local Authorization History without Approval. It is distinct from
Secret Name Access: granting `av list` does not grant `av history`, and granting
`av history` does not grant `av list`. Without a matching grant, each history
read requires Approval. Every read is itself recorded before the history is
returned.

### Authorization Record

A local record of an Authorization Request and its Authorization Decision. It includes the decision source, Launcher, Gate Client, Target, Secret Names, and operation. For an automically authorized Secret Use, it also records the Target's available Hardened Runtime posture at authorization time. This posture is diagnostic metadata, not Target identity evidence or an authorization input.

New records may retain the eligible Verified Launcher’s designated requirement
so History can offer a Temporary Launcher Denial after the caller exits. This
recorded identity may narrow access only; History never grants authority.

Automic Vault persists and verifies a record of allowed Secret Use before releasing a Secret. Failure to persist that required record denies the request. Records of denials and failures are best effort. Authorization History is bounded and local; it is not an append-only, tamper-proof, or complete forensic log.

The Mac makes Authorization History available for up to 30 days and a configurable
encrypted record payload limit (1–1024 MiB, default 25 MiB), whichever bound is
reached first. SQLite overhead is additional to this payload limit. Expired ciphertext
is filtered from reads immediately and pruned on writes or a coalesced
background pass after a read. A dormant database may temporarily retain it.
The dashboard browses all retained records, grouped by day. An unqualified
`av history` shows the newest 50 records; `av history --since` may request an
explicit window up to the retention limit. The CLI returns every retained record
in that window from one authorized snapshot, transferred in bounded chunks.
Terminal tables use a pager unless `--no-pager` is set; JSON and redirected
output do not. Retention does not make
Authorization History complete: same-user compromise or storage failure can
damage or delete it.

## Least Authority

Durable trust binds one Authorization Gate to one Verified Launcher. A Direct
Access Rule additionally binds one exact Secret Name, but intentionally leaves
the Target and arguments under that Launcher’s control. A Blessing binds one
exact script and its capabilities. Approval binds one complete request and
process. When detached-process access is enabled, Retained Launcher Provenance
may preserve the same gate-and-Launcher attribution for one exact live process
execution after its parent chain disappears. Authority does not propagate to
sibling Launchers, changed scripts, another gate, a later process execution, or
a broader operation.

A Temporary Access Grant further narrows its Verified Launcher authority by an
exact Agent Task Context and accepted runtime posture. Because the task label is
forgeable, this narrows matching but does not strengthen Launcher identity.

## Zeroconf above the security boundary

Terminals, shells, IDEs, agents, harnesses, and projects keep using their existing commands. They need no Automic Vault plugin, policy file, or integration. Automic Vault discovers the local toolchain, applies secure defaults, and handles Tool-specific mediation beneath it. The user acts where intent matters: choosing Hardening, storing Credentials, approving requests, and trusting Launchers.

## Current implementation names

The following identifiers remain in storage or code for compatibility. New product language should use the canonical term.

| Legacy identifier or label | Canonical term |
| --- | --- |
| `No Access`, `noAccess` | Approval Required |
| `Read Only Access`, `readOnly` | Read Only; Read & Update at the Homebrew Execution Gate |
| `Read & Update Access`, `readOnlyAndUpdates` | Read & Update |
| `Local Write Access`, `readOnlyAndLocalWrites` | Local Write |
| `Trusted Access`, `fullExceptSecretDumps` | Write Access |
| `Full Access`, `fullIncludingSecretDumps` | Full Access |
| `secretDump` | Secret Disclosure or Elevated Secret Application, according to the operation |
| `mutating` | Local Write, System Write, Remote Write, or a combination |
| Secret Usage, access log, audit log | Authorization History |
| iPhone Activity | Request History |
| automatic approval | automic authorization |
| isotope key | Secret or Secret Name |
| caller | Launcher, Gate Client, or Target, according to the role |

Persisted raw values and external compatibility flags may retain legacy spelling. Their display names and documentation follow this language.
